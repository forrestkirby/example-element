# Example Element

This is the example element for the YOOtheme Pro page builder. It demonstrates how to configure an element, how to extend its functionality and how to make use of the different field types. For more information on how to create a custom element read the [elements](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/developers-elements.md) documentation.

## Quick Installation

The example elements can be added using a child-theme or a Joomla or WordPress plugin. The easiest way to quickly try it out is by using a child theme. 

1. Create and activate a child theme in [Joomla](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/developers-child-themes#create-a-child-theme) or [WordPress](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/wordpress/developers-child-themes#create-a-child-theme) for YOOtheme Pro.
2. [Download](https://github.com/yootheme/example-element/archive/master.zip) and unzip the example element.
3. Create a `builder` directory in the child theme and copy the `example` and `example_item` directories into it.
4. Open YOOtheme Pro and the *Example Element* is available in the element library.
